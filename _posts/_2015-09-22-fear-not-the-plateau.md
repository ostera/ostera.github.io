Yes, I know, it’s been a while.

I’ve been busy being blind and scared. Blind to most things I didn’t know I
didn’t know, and scared that there will be more. But a good kind of scared –
the kind that looks at you in the eyes, inquisitively, yelling if you dare to
be brave.

If I have to be completely honest, I think you can never really get out of
Plato’s cave. Just as when you get out of the cave, you find yourself trapped within the next one.

Think caves inside of caves.

A bigger one, where there's more light, with perhaps more room, filled with new,
different ghosts and phallacies and realities and dreams.

> In reality, if the whole mass of the universe is composed by quarks, what is the difference between solid rock and the skies other than it's internal organization? It really threatens the poetry in Plato's allegory.

Hence my blindness – A small town kid with a passion for building things got
out of his cave. A cave of routine and dogma, where you graduate from high school
to go to university, and 5 years later you get a degree that defines who you will
be and what you will do for the rest of your life.

And what I found was a overwhelming.

An immense world of entrepreneurship, freelancing, networking, cheap flights,
thai food, hostels, pub crawling and conferences, awkward situations and unbelivebably smart people, incredibly diverse mindsets and cultures and ideas.

Built out of hopes and dreams and pains and loves. And I was happy.

But it was of course, just a bigger cave.

Over the years I've met lots of people who were quite comfortable where they were,
complacent. Perhaps just as many times I've encountered people that once brought to know
that there was an outside, realized where they were.
