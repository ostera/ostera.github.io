Yes I know, it’s been a while.

I’ve been busy being blind and scared. Blind to most things I didn’t know I
didn’t know, and scared that there will be more. But a good kind of scared –
the kind that looks at you in the eyes, inquisitively, and yells if you dare to
be brave.

If I had to be completely honest, I’d say you can never really get out of
Plato’s cave. Or that there’s always a plateau to overcome – maybe not
immediately after the last one, but lurking.

Just as when you get out of the cave, you find yourself trapped in the outside
world, where what previously were solid rock walls become layers and layers of
atmosphere and clouds and skies. 

And then it hits you – if the whole mass of the universe is made of quarks,
then what is the metaphorical difference between solid rock and the skies? I’d
say none but it'd kill the poetry in Plato’s allegory. 

Hence my blindness – A small town kid with a passion for building things got
out of the cave of routine and dogma only to discover a world of
entrepreneurship, freelancing, cheap flights, hostels, incredibly diverse
mindsets and cultures and pains and desires and ideas – and the list goes on
and on.

And yet 5 years later, I find myself moving across the world one more time,
just to immerse myself in the very routine I pledged to fight.

I became the enemy.

But why? Why would I do such a thing? Because I plateaued.
